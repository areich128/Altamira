# Altamira F' project
### Alex Reich Summer 2024

The purpose of this project is to get more familiar with FPrime, cmake, and embedded systems in general in preparation for working on SRL's avionics in the fall. Flight computer will be launched on the Altamira low power rocket on July 27, 2024.

I will be creating components for the BNO085 sensor and the BMP388 sensor. Data from these will be stored in an onboard SD card.

### General Notes on the BNO085
This software interfaces with the BNO using SHTP protocol. I have written a custom function which creates the necessary packets. That packet is then written to the device

This project framework was auto-generated by the F' utility tool. 

F´ (F Prime) is a component-driven framework that enables rapid development and deployment of spaceflight and other embedded software applications.
